# Random_name_generator
Randomly generate students names to answer questions in class.

Development ideas:
  - Random selection not to pick a student that has previously been selected
  - Scroll through names slower as it gets closer to picking a name
  - Play sound effects for individual students once they have been selected.
  - Add a countdown timer for students to answer the question by.
